"""Python Startup File

Add this file to ~/.py_startup to add history between sessions and auto-completion via the ESC key to the interactive Python interpreter.

After adding this file, put something like the following line in your .bash_profile:

    export PYTHONSTARTUP=/Users/richardhenry/.py_startup

Requires a recent version of Python and the readline package, which you can install from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/readline.
